# 🗳️ Voting Machine Project
 💬PT-BR: Projeto de urna eletrônica criado durante o primeiro semestre da faculdade de ciência da computação.
 
 💬EN: A voting machine project created during the first semester of college. Since the main information is written in portuguese, considering the brazilian electoral system, I put a summary right below:

1. **Register candidate**: here, insert the candidate's name, political office for which his/her is running for, the party number and its abbreviation (it may not be in this order);
2. **Register elector**: enter the elector's name and a code to identify him/her (brazilian CPF);
3. **Vote**: here, you will enter elector's information for voting based on candidate's electoral number;
4. **Vote counting**: this option will show you who was elected (make sure to add a good number of candidates and electors);
5. **Stats**: this option will show if the election results are reliable and which party elected more or fewer candidates.
